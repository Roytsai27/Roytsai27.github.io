I am currently working as a Ph.D. student in computer science at National Taiwan University in MSLab under the supervision of professor Shou-De Lin.
My research interests include machine learning, deep learning with its application in recommender systems, NLP, and social network analysis. I have published papers in machine learning top conferences such as SIGKDD, CIKM, and top journal TKDE.
